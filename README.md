## Current and Future Societies
Following you'll find a list of the societies which are currently playable, are in development or are planned for future releases. There are three categories of society which will be added through this mod. **Historical Societies** are societies which are at least reasonable believed to have existed in the Crusader Kings II timeframe (769 - 1453).  

Do you have an idea for a society? Let us know! Send an email to <enter email here> with the subject "[New Society] <society name>" where <society name> is replaced by the name of your new society. Please also state your core concept how the society will work and what cool new ways to play the game it offers. If we like your idea, it will soon pop up in the list below!

### Historical
**Historical Societies** are societies which are at least reasonable believed to have existed in the Crusader Kings II timeframe (769 - 1453). They aim to deliver an extended expierience for everyone without interfering with the core concepts of the game.

### Extended
**Extended Societies** do not have any historical background but will be, for most players, be thematically fitting enough to not disperse immersion while playing. They aim to bring the most possible fun to the game through new mechanics without outright making the game a mess.

#### (In Development) Legion of Mars
We, the followers of the **Legion of Mars**, hereby declare to do everything in our power to let the Roman Empire rise from it's ashes. We will uphold all roman traditions and always seek to excel at those. Our foremost goal is to dominate our opponents through power, leadership and military administration to let the empire once again shines in its glory.

#### (Planned) The Free Men

#### (Planned) Koredugaw Circle

### Supernatural
**Supernatural Societies** aim to deliver completly ahistorical and physically not possible societies where everything can be possible. They do convert the game into a kind of crazy place with to some extend stupid and overall changes to how the game will be.

#### None yet planned

## Resources not from us
Even though we try to make all the stuff ourself, there are just some things that are so crazily better made from others, which we couldn't resist using. We carefully check for any 3rd party resources to have licenses which allow usage and will never use anything without a permission. If any license we found is outdated and the resources are not allowed to be used by us anymore, please inform us at <enter email here>.

## Working on Extended Societies
Currently im working on this alone but im always thankful for anyone trying to help develop this idea into an addition to a wonderful game. Even if you do not like to work in a team, you can just fork this repository and add features by yourself. Following things are always needed:

* Coder
* Asset creation
* Sound & Music Composers
* Localization
  * All languages (English, German, **French**, **Spanish**)
  * Having people just do the wording would also help alot, cause most of the time you know a better, more fun and engaging wording than I do
