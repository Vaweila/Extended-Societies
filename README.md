## Current and Future Societies
Following you'll find a list of the societies which are currently playable, are in development or are planned for future releases. There are three categories of society which will be added through this mod. **Historical Societies** are societies which are at least reasonable believed to have existed in the Crusader Kings II timeframe (769 - 1453). **Extended Societies** do not have any historical background but will be, for most players, be thematically fitting enough to not disperse immersion while playing. **Supernatural Societies** aim to deliver completly ahistorical and physically not possible societies where everything can be possible.

Do you have an idea for a society? Let us know! Send an email to <enter email here> with the subject "[New Society] <society name>" where <society name> is replaced by the name of your new society. Please also state your core concept how the society will work and what cool new ways to play the game it offers. If we like your idea, it will soon pop up in the list below!
